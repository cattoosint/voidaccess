## ⚡ The OSINT Powerhouse
Commercial threat intelligence platforms often charge prohibitive annual fees for capabilities that can be run on private hardware. **VoidAccess** democratizes high-end dark web intelligence by providing an automated, end-to-end workflow:

- **Query Refinement**: Intelligent search term optimization using LLMs.
- **Multilingual Search**: Deep-web fan-out across English, Russian, and Chinese engines.
- **Entity Extraction**: Autonomous identification of wallets, IOCs, PGP keys, and more.
- **Relationship Mapping**: Dynamic graph generation from extracted data co-occurrence.
- **Structured Export**: STIX 2.1, MISP, Sigma, and CSV support.

## 🛠️ How It Works (The 13-Step Pipeline)

VoidAccess handles the complexity of dark web research through a rigorous sequence:

1. **LLM Query Refinement**: Optimizes search terms for .onion engine indexing.
2. **Global Fan-out Search**: Queries 16+ Tor engines across multiple languages.
3. **Intelligence Filtering**: LLM filters noise, keeping only relevant intelligence pages.
4. **Multi-Source Enrichment**: Pulls from AlienVault OTX, abuse.ch, ransomware.live, CISA KEV, and Shodan.
5. **Recursive .onion Discovery**: Discovers hidden links via seed URL crawling.
6. **Vector Cache Check**: Avoids redundant scraping for recently visited pages.
7. **Tor-Routed Scraping**: Safely fetches page content with a 1MB safety cap.
8. **Persistence**: Stores new content in the local vector cache.
9. **Intelligence Merging**: Combines scraped and enriched data for processing.
10. **Advanced Extraction**: Regex, NER, and LLM-based entity identification.
11. **Historical Cross-Referencing**: Validates data against seed datasets.
12. **Graph Construction**: Builds relationship nodes based on co-occurrence.
13. **Final Intelligence Summary**: LLM generates a structured technical briefing.
