## The OSINT Powerhouse

Commercial threat intelligence platforms often charge prohibitive annual fees for capabilities that can be run on private hardware. **VoidAccess** democratizes high-end dark web intelligence by providing an automated, end-to-end workflow:

- **Query Refinement**: Intelligent search term optimization using LLMs.
- **Multilingual Search**: Deep-web fan-out across English, Russian, and Chinese engines.
- **Entity Extraction**: Autonomous identification of wallets, IOCs, PGP keys, and more.
- **Relationship Mapping**: Dynamic graph generation from extracted data co-occurrence.
- **Structured Export**: STIX 2.1, MISP, Sigma, and CSV support.

## How It Works (The 13-Step Pipeline)

VoidAccess handles the complexity of dark web research through a rigorous sequence:

1. **LLM Query Refinement**: Optimizes search terms for .onion engine indexing.
2. **Parallel Collection**: Queries 16+ Tor search engines simultaneously with paste sites (Pastebin, dpaste, paste.ee), GitHub, GitLab, and curated RSS security feeds.
3. **Intelligence Filtering**: LLM filters noise, keeping only relevant intelligence pages.
4. **Multi-Source Enrichment**: Pulls from AlienVault OTX, abuse.ch, ransomware.live, CISA KEV, Shodan, GreyNoise, AbuseIPDB, Feodo Tracker, C2IntelFeeds, and more — running in parallel with collection.
5. **Recursive .onion Discovery**: Discovers hidden links via seed URL crawling.
6. **Vector Cache Check**: Avoids redundant scraping for recently visited pages (24h TTL).
7. **Tor-Routed Scraping**: Safely fetches page content with a 1MB safety cap.
8. **Persistence**: Stores new content in the local vector cache.
9. **Intelligence Merging**: Combines scraped and enriched data for processing.
10. **Advanced Extraction**: Regex, NER, and LLM-based entity identification.
11. **Historical Cross-Referencing**: Validates data against seed datasets.
12. **Graph Construction**: Builds relationship nodes based on co-occurrence.
13. **Final Intelligence Summary**: LLM generates a structured technical briefing.

## LLM & Enrichment Ecosystem

### Supported LLM Providers

| Provider | Models | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenRouter** | DeepSeek, Llama 3.3, Claude Haiku | Recommended default; free models available |
| **Groq** | Llama 3.3, Llama 3.1 | Fast inference; free tier |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o Mini | API key required |
| **Anthropic** | Claude Haiku | Haiku is the tested default; other models work via manual override. |
| **Google Gemini** | Gemini 1.5 Flash, 2.5 Pro | Free tier via AI Studio |
| **Ollama** | Any local model | Air-gapped; no API key needed |

The default is **DeepSeek via OpenRouter** — fast and strong on technical security content. With free-tier LLMs (Groq free, OpenRouter free models, or Ollama) the cost is **$0**. With paid models like DeepSeek via OpenRouter it is **under $0.50 per investigation**. For fully air-gapped deployments, Ollama runs entirely locally.

### Optional Enrichment API Keys

All enrichment sources that require a key degrade gracefully when the key is absent — they are skipped without failing the investigation. Keys marked "free" require registration but have no cost.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3 (recommended — used by setup.sh for secret generation; Linux/macOS fall back to /dev/urandom if absent, Windows setup.bat may require it)
- One LLM API key — or Ollama for fully local operation (free)

**Free LLM options (no credit card required):**
- [Groq](https://console.groq.com) — fast, free tier, Llama 3.3 70B
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) — free models including DeepSeek and Llama 3.3
- [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) — Gemini free tier
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) — fully local, no internet required

### Installation

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

**Windows (native):**
```bat
setup.bat
```

The interactive wizard creates `.env`, generates `JWT_SECRET` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, prompts for your LLM provider (one of: Groq, OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Ollama), optionally collects threat-intel keys (`OTX_API_KEY`, `VT_API_KEY`), optionally enables Redis, sets the admin password, and starts the Docker stack.

</div>

### Starting and Stopping

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**
```bash
./start.sh    # build and start all services
./stop.sh     # stop all services
```

**Windows (native):**
```bat
start.bat     :: build and start all services
stop.bat      :: stop all services
```

Once running, open **http://localhost:3001** in your browser.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./public/start_gif.gif" width="100%" alt="Starting VoidAccess">
</div>

### Getting a JWT (API access)

`setup.sh` creates a default admin account at `admin@voidaccess.tech` with the password you provided during the wizard.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@voidaccess.tech", "password": "yourpassword"}'
```

Use the returned token in an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for API requests.

### Running your first investigation (API)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/investigations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "LockBit ransomware infrastructure 2024"}'
```

The investigation starts in `pending`, moves to `processing`, and completes in 3–5 minutes with a summary, extracted entities, relationship graph, and export-ready artifacts.

## Architecture

Four Docker services:

| Service | Technology | Port |
|---|---|---|
| **postgres** | PostgreSQL 16 | 5433 |
| **tor** | Tor SOCKS5 proxy | 9050 |
| **fastapi** | Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy | 8000 |
| **nextjs** | Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind | 3001 |

The FastAPI backend runs a 13-step pipeline triggered by `POST /investigations`. Every external call has `try/except` with graceful fallback — the pipeline never hard-crashes. API docs are available at **http://localhost:8000/docs** when running.

> **Note on `voidaccess/voidaccess/`** — the nested directory holds the core LLM utilities (`llm.py`, `llm_utils.py`) and is imported at runtime by the API routes (`from voidaccess.llm import ...`). The nested naming reflects the original package structure from the project's pre-API baseline.

## Troubleshooting

**Services won't start:**
```bash
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . ps
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . logs -f
```

**Port conflicts** (3001 or 8000 already in use):
- macOS/Linux: `lsof -i :3001` to find what's using it
- Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :3001`

**Tor not connecting:** The Tor service takes 30–60 seconds to bootstrap on first start. Check health with `./check_health.sh`. This script verifies Tor proxy connectivity, LLM provider reachability, and dark web search engine availability.

**No .env file:** Run `bash setup.sh` (macOS/Linux/WSL) or `setup.bat` (Windows) before starting.

**Docker build takes a long time:** First build downloads ~3GB of layers. Subsequent builds use the Docker layer cache and are much faster.

## Content Safety

Every investigation runs through mandatory content safety filters before results reach the UI or appear in the graph. CSAM, gore, snuff content, and other prohibited material are blocked at the query stage, URL validation, content scanning, and post-extraction entity filtering. These filters are mandatory and cannot be disabled.

## Acceptable Use

VoidAccess is for authorized security research, threat intelligence gathering, and law enforcement purposes only. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all local laws and ethical standards. See [docs/USAGE_POLICY.md](docs/USAGE_POLICY.md) for the full policy.
